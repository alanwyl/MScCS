        The composition fee for each 6-credit course is HK$13,000*. Project has a composition fee of HK$26,000 and the Dissertation has a composition fee of HK$52,000. Total composition fee for the two study modes are therefore as follows:\n
        \n
        10 courses + Project:\n
        (HK$13,000 x 10) + (HK$26,000) = HK$156,000\n
        \n
        8 Courses + Dissertation:\n
        (HK$13,000 x 8) + (HK$52,000) = HK$156,000\n
        \n
